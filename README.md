# 🤖 Character Simulator RAG

A powerful AI-based character simulation system using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to create realistic, knowledge-aware digital personas that interact like real humans.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Simulates custom characters with unique personality and tone.
- 📚 Integrates RAG to inject relevant knowledge into responses.
- 🔁 Maintains dialogue history and character consistency.
- 🔍 Uses semantic search (e.g., FAISS or ElasticSearch) to retrieve relevant documents.
- 🌐 Easily extendable to support multiple characters or domains.

---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- `Python`
- `LangChain`
- `FAISS` or `ElasticSearch`
- `LLMs` (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar)
- `Streamlit` or `Gradio` (optional frontend)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Character Definition**: Define the character's traits, speech style, and goals.
2. **Document Ingestion**: Upload or link a knowledge base related to the character.
3. **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.
4. **Response Generation**: LLM crafts a reply as if it's the character, using the retrieved docs + prompt conditioning.
